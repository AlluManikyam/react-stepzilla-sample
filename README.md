For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:
* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.
You can delete or rename the other files.
You may create subdirectories inside `src`. For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by webpack.<br>
You need to **put any JS and CSS files inside `src`**, otherwise webpack wonâ€™t see them.
Only files inside `public` can be used from `public/index.html`.<br>
You can, however, create more top-level directories.<br>
They will not be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation.
